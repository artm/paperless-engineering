# Mention any apps you've built or projects you've enjoyed working on

For the last 12 years I have been working at [V2\_Lab][1.1] on a wide
variety of art and culture related projects involving software or
electronics or both. The projects I'm most proud of are on [my
resume][2.2], among those that just didn't make it into the top N are:

 * [Beijerkoppen][1.2] - talking heads on the street of Rotterdam, our
   software continuously records satellite / terrestrial TV programs and
   searches for what looks like news programs. With a little help of a
   maintainer it eventually learns to capture and keep only fragments of
   a newsreaders which are then continuously played back on three large
   screens. The software is a wild mix of ruby, C++, perl and various
   unix utilities set up to glue together the capture, intelligence,
   display and maintainers web interface.
 * [Run Motherfucker Run][1.3] - a treadmill controlled interactive
   movie projection. I wrote the network controlled video player and a
   non-linear plot description language that allowed the artist to
   describe how movie progression depends on participant's behavior.
 * [Physiognomic Scrutinizer][1.4] and [Mirror Piece][1.5] - a series of
   interactive works (culminating in [15 Minutes of Biometric Fame][1.6]),
   that misuse face recognition technology for amusement of festival
   goers and museum visitors. All three works detect faces in the
   audience and search for "matching" faces in their databases of
   (in)famous persons, wrapping the process in a security gate, fancy
   mirror or large metal robot respectively. In all cases I did most of
   the programming, barring the user facing visuals of the first work.

# Should clippy be brought back?

Is he gone then?

I'm quite indifferent towards clippy as I prefer plain text formats
anyway.

"Oh, but your resume is in PDF"

Yes, and it even has clickable links. I like the way [Careers 2.0][2.1]
allows me to maintain [my resume][2.2] on-line with links, tags and all.
