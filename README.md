guide to the solution
=====================

1. race.rb - original solution driver, just call it like `ruby race.rb DISTANCE`

2. race-stat.rb - Monte Carlo race, call like `ruby race-stat.rb`, stop
   the competition by issuing INT signal (Ctrl+C on most sane systems).
   This version will run multiple races and collect simple statistics to
   prove Cat's superiority over Dog.

3. race-sim.rb - solution using discrete event simulation - makes little
   sense in the simple case as formulated, but could be useful if the
   animals were more alive and get tired or agitated and their speed
   would vary from leap to leap. Call it like `ruby race-sim.rb
DISTANCE`
